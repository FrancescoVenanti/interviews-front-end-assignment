## Getting Started

    purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### before running the client

-   Go on the server directory (cd server) and follow the instruction on the readme file in there.

-   in my machine the server was running on the port 8080. if for any reason in yours it's running on a different port
    you can simply use the replace function to replace 8080 with the number of your port.

### Running the client

-   Once the installation is complete run the command npm run dev.

-   Ctrl + click the provided link and enjoy the project.

### Built with

-   React + Vite + Typescript

#### Side notes

-   The app has been build with a mobile first approach.
-   I tried to follow the mockups adding a bit of a personal twist to them without changing them too much.
-   Some of the logic and designs can surely be improved but i tried to keep everything simple and readable.
