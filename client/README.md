# Get sarted

-   first go on the server directory and follow the instruction on the readme file in there.
    then come back to this directory, run npm install and then npm run dev.

-   in my machine the server was running on the port 8080. if for any reason in yours it's running on a different port
    you can simply use the replace function to replace 8080 with the number of your port.
